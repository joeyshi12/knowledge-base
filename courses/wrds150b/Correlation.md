**Citation**
Correlation is used to measure the association between variables (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2013)
*Do not make claims of causality from correlation*

**Assess normality**
- Make a histogram of your variables
- "normality assumption was assessed with histogram plot. Confirmed or found violation?"

For my dataset, probably use spearman correlation instead of pearson

P-value determines whether the correlation computed is statistically significant (not a coincidence)
- Cut-off: less than 0.05

## Writing the result
Describe what has been found to answer the RQ
- Remind readers of RQ and what graphs have been done
- Refer to scatter plot in main text
- State "r" value and p-value
- Present nature of correlation. Whether the "r" is strong or not WITH citations (check slides)
- State if correlation is statistically significant and the corresponding p value (or just p<0.XX)
- Provide contexts for reader to make sense of the graphs

## Writing methodology
- Based on what you have actually presented (which pair of variables)
- Report data processing / screening / cleansing
- Purpose of running correlation and type of correlation
- Variables involved
- Describe how you ensire the validity of the correlation analysis (assumption testing)

## Reminders
- Limit number of rounds for correlation analysis
- If more than one round of correlation analysis, only summarize the major trend.
- Do NOT claim cause-effect relationship
- Always report (1) strength; (2) types of relationship
- Scatter plot: check slides on data visualization
- No p-hacking...
- Not having significant results is OK!
