**Introduction**
Studies in the past have investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on unemployment rate in European countries (Study A, B, C).
Study A observes the relationship between the number of COVID-19 cases and the unemployment rate in Norway.
Study B aims to determine whether the number of infected cases cause changes in unemployment rate for other European countries.
Study C assesses the change in unemployment rate in Slovakia due to the pandemic by comparing the trend of the Slovakia's unemployment rate before the pandemic with the reported unemployment rates during the pandemic.

These studies have produced a variety of results regarding how the unemployment rate in specific European countries has been affected by the pandemic.
Study A finds there exists a strong correlation between the number of COVID-19 cases and unemployment rate in Norway.
Study B discovers the number of cases causes unemployment in Germany, Italy, and the UK. 
Study C finds there is a increase in unemployment rate in Slovakia due to influences from the pandemic.

Although these studies have addressed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on unemployment rate in different ways, their results are isolated and narrowed to specific countries in Europe.
Indeed, the influence of COVID-19 on unemployment rate world-wide has not been thoroughly explored .
Therefore, it is necessary to extend knowledge in this area.
In particular, this paper aims to answer the question: is there an association between the number of COVID-19 cases and unemployment rate across different countries in the world.
