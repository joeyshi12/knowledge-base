**Introduction**
Studies in the past have investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on unemployment rate in European countries (Study A, B, C). 
Study B observes the relationship between the number of COVID-19 cases and the unemployment rate in Norway.
Study A aims to determine whether the number of infected cases cause changes in unemployment rate for other European countries.
Study C assesses the change in unemployment rate in Slovakia due to the pandemic by comparing the trend of the Slovakia's unemployment rate before the pandemic with the reported unemployment rates during the pandemic.

These studies have produced a variety of results regarding how the unemployment rate in specific European countries has been affected by the pandemic. Study B finds there exists a strong correlation between the number of COVID-19 cases and unemployment rate in Norway. Study A discovers the number of cases causes unemployment in Germany, Italy, and the UK.  Study C finds there is a increase in unemployment rate in Slovakia due to influences from the pandemic.

Although these studies have addressed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on unemployment rate in different ways, their results are isolated and narrowed to certain countries in Europe. Indeed, the impact of   Therefore, it is necessary to broaden the scope

In particular, this paper aims to answer the question: is there an association between the number of COVID-19 cases and unemployment rate across different countries in the world.

aims to determine whether the number of COVID-19 cases causes changes in the unemployment rate for certain European countries. Similarly, Study B also explores this relationship by observing the correlation in another European country: Norway. Study C assesses changes in unemployment rate due to the  COVID-19 pandemic by observing the differences between the trend of Slovakia's unemployment rate before the COVID-19 pandemic and the reported unemployment rates during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Study A discovers that the number of COVID-19 cases causes an increase in unemployment rate for Germany, Italy, and the UK. Likewise, Study B shows that there exists a strong correlation between the number of COVID-19 cases and unemployment rate in Slovakia.

Many of these studies have investigated the association between the number of COVID-19 cases and unemployment rate over time in different European countries.
However, some critical questions remain: is there an association between number of COVID-19 cases and unemployment rate over different countries across the world. 


**Methodology**
We will use the unemployment rates from the OECD database during the period of January 2020 to January 2021.
Each row in this dataset represents a country at the beginning of each month.
We will be primary focusing on the unemployment rate column.

We will also be using the daily COVID-19 cases reports from the WHO.
Each row in this dataset represents a country on a day during the period of January 2020 to the present.

We will also be using the international population distribution reports from the UN.
Each row represents a country or region's population over different years. 

Procedure:
- average covid cases in Jan 2020 - Jan 2021
- normalize the average number of people infected with COVID-19 as a percentage of people infected in different countries.
- Run correlation between percentage infected and covid-19 cases for each country


We will find the Pearson correlation coefficient (D) between the number of COVID-19 cases and unemployment rate at the beginning of each month across different countries around the world.
