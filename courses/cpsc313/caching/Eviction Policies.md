## Belady's Algorithm
- This is the best eviction algorithm
- Always evict the item that we use farthest in the future

## LRU: Least Recently Used
- Evict the item that was used farthest in the past

## LFU: Least Frequently Used
- Keep track of how many times each item is used and replace the one with the smallest frequency count
