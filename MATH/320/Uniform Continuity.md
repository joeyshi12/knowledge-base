# Uniform Continuity
Let $X, Y$ be metric spaces and $f: X \to Y$. $f$ is **uniformly continuous** if for any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists $\delta > 0$, such that for any $p,q\in X$ with $d_X(p, q) < \delta$, we have $d_Y(f(p), f(q)) < \epsilon$.

## Theorem 4.19
If $X, Y$ are compact metric spaces and $f: X \to Y$ is continuous, then $f$ is uniformly continuous.

## Theorem 4.22
Let $X, Y$ be metric spaces and let $f: X \to Y$ be continuous. If $E\subset X$ is [[Connected Sets | connected]], then $f(E)$ is also connected.
