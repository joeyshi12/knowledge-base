## Task abstraction in genomics

## Example

30 cancer tissue samples
Task: see which genes likely to cause a cancer tissue to die from exposed to drug
- Abstractions
    - attribute: gene type
        - categorical
    - attribute: # dead
        - quantitative
    - task: find high values
 
## Solution

Which genes are likely to cause the difference
- Identify those genes
- Compare gene expression of pathway genes between two groups
What role they play in that pathway
- Locate the outlier in the network
- Explore the topology
