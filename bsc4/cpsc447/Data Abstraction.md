Abstract domain-specific language to general visualization language

## Domain Characterization
- Details of an application domain
- Groups of users, target domain, their questions + data
    - Varies wildly by domain
    - Specific to get traction
-  Domain questions/problems
    - Break down into simpler abstract tasks

We want to abstract data & tasks
- Map what and why into generalized terms

Find {action, target} pairs is a good starting point for vocab
- Often require more precision
Rule of thumb
- Remove all domain jargon
