## Marks
- Geometric primitives
    - Points, lines, areas
- Channels
    - Control appearance of marks

## Notes on analyzing marks
- If not length-coded => probably not a line mark
- Area, shape does not mean anything => not interlocking areas

## Marks as constraints
- Mark type constrains/restricts what else can be encoded
    - Points: 0 constraints on size, can encode more attributes w/ size & shape
    - Lines: 1 constraint/restriction on size (length), can still size code other way (width)
    - Interlocking areas: 2 constraints on size (length/width), cannot size or shape code
        - Interlocking: size, shape, position
