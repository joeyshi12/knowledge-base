## Properties

Let $G = \left< a \right>$ be a cyclic group.
1. Any 2 cyclic groups of the same order are isomorphic.
2. Any subgroup $H$ of $G$ is cyclic and
    1. If $G$ is infinite and any subgroup $H \neq \{1\}$ of $G$ is infinite, then $n \to \left<a^n\right>$ from $\mathbb{N}$ to the set of subgroups of $G$ is bijective.
    2. If $o(G) = r$, then $q = o(H) \mid o(G)$ and $H$ is a unique subgroup of $G$ of order $q$.
3. $\displaystyle o(g^s) = \frac{n}{(n, s)}$ for any $g\in{G}$.
