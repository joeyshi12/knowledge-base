The link layer is implemented inside a chip called the network adapter/NIC (Network Interface Controller)

Passing datagram up to network layer is handled by software

The network adapter implements many [[Link Layer Services]] in hardware
- Encapsulates the datagram in a link-layer frame (filling in the frameâ€™s various fields), and then
- Transmits the frame into the communication link, following the link-access protocol
