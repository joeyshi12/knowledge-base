    - Explain why the link layer may use "error correction".
    - Know three techniques for error detection: parity (1D and 2D), checksumming, CRC.
    - Understand what errors can be detected and corrected in 2D parity checking.
    - Advantages of CRC over parity checking and checksumming.

3. DHCP
    - Describe the purpose of [[DHCP]]
