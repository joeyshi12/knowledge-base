Ordered delivery -> delivers segments in-order (in M6)  
Bidirectional -> data flows both ways  
Unidirectional -> data can flow only one way  
Connection oriented -> first makes a connection between ends  
Connection-less -> no hand-shake
Segmentation -> cut the data stream into segments for IP  
Data bundling -> optimization to send full packets (Nagle â€“not  covered)  
Stream-oriented -> sends a stream of bytes  
Message-oriented -> send messages  
Multicast -> can multicast on LAN  
Non-duplication -> handle duplicate packets
