## Network Address Translation
- A NAT router behaves to the outside world as a single device with a **single IP address**
- A NAT router has an interface for the home network
    - Home networks have the same subnet address 10.0.0.0/24
    - The IP address space 10.0.0.0/8 is reserved for private networks
- IPv6 does not need NATs since the address space for IPv6 is much bigger than IPv4
