**Question:**

Assuming the routing given in the previous question for the network shown, which is the same as the network in the previous question.   If a datagram arrives at the gateway router for 192.168.5.28, to which of the **networks** is it forwarded?  (Assumes you have assigned the networks as given in the previous question).

Correct Answer:

point-to-point network between the gateway and wireless router

**Explanation:**

The hosts in the wireless network are all of the type 192.168.5.Y This datagram must be destined for a host in the wifi network and the next hop on the route would be to the network between the gateway and the wireless router.
