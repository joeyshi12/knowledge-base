## A.  General Knowledge of Cryptographic Protocols
-   Describe the four main network security problems: confidentiality, authentication, integrity, access and availability.
-   Explain the difference between symmetric and asymmetric cryptography (public key versus shared secrets)
-   Explain how private keys and public keys are used 
-   Describe the the issues associated with verifying a public key
-   Describe and apply the techniques that can be used to guarantee message integrity.
-   Describe and apply the techniques used for digitally signing a message.
-   Describe and apply the techniques used for ensuring message confidentiality
-   Be able to trace the steps for providing one or more of the following: message integrity, digitally sign a document, and confidentiality 
-   Given a data exchange scenario identify weaknesses and explain how to fix the problem 
-   Understand play-back and person-in-the-middle exploits.
-   Understand basic cryptographic terms and Kurose&Ross notation for describing the cryptographic steps.

## B. Security protocols and devices in practice.
-   Understand the trade-offs of providing security at difference levels of the Internet stack.
-   Know in general what SSH, SSL (TLS), and IPsec are  and what it provides, know where in the stack it is implemented.
-   For SSL, understand the basics techniques of a transport-type protocol that protects against play-back and person-in-the-middle exploits.
-   Examples of applications that use these protocols (e.g. https in a browser).
-   Know what it means to create a tunnel and how a tunnel can move data from one network to another.
-   Know what a VPN is and why they exist
-   Know what  a firewall is and why they exist.
-   Specify, in general terms, what a firewall rule would be for certain scenarios.
