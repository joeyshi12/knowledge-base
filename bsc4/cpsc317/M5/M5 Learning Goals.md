## A. Basic Definitions
-  Define the terms bandwidth, latency, throughput, goodput, and jitter.
-   Explain the difference between bandwidth, latency, throughput and goodput
-   Define the terms "bits on the wire", and "packets in flight" and be able to apply the definitions .
-   Performcomputationswithrespecttobandwidth,throughput,goodput,andlatency
-   Calculate the protocol overheads with respect to performance (goodput vs bandwidth)
-   Describe how jitter is introduced into a network

## B. Delay
- List and define the types of delay and how they contribute to delay.
- Calculate the end-to-end delay in a network.
- Perform bottleneck analysis on a path
- Computetrafficintensityandrelatetrafficintensitytoqueuingdelays.
- Calculate link utilization
- Use the formula of Average Delay = S/(1-U) where U is the network utilization and S is the average service time for a single packet. This formula is only relevant for randomly arriving packets.
