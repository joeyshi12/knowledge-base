# Learning Goals
1. Design
    - Fundamental challenges
    - Requirements for communication
    - Design decisions for developing the Internet and design goals
    - Define packet-switching
    - Define statistical multiplexing
    - Define TDM, FDM, communication channel
    - Pros, cons of statistical multiplexing
    - Circuit switching vs. packet-switching (not the same!)
    - Pros, cons of packet-switching vs. circuit-switching
2. Protocol, layering, encapsulation
    - Define protocol
    - Connection between protocols, state, actions, finite state machine
    - Where functionality and state resides in the Internet
    - Roles of abstraction, layering, modularization in the design of the Internet
3. Properties of the internet
    - Descibe the internet and some physical components
    - List layers of Internet, protocol stack, in proper order
    - Define function of each layer in the protocol stack
    - Describe how a stream of data is turned into packets
    - Describe the Internet protocol stack (TCP/IP, hourglass, protocol graphs)
    - Encapsulation and structure of packets flowing in the Internet
4. Internet design principles
    - End-to-end principle and an example of how its applied for FTP
    - Pros, cons of smart vs. dumb network (network neutrality)
    - Fate-sharing design principle, how is it used?
