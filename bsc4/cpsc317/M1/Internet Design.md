# Telcos versus Internet
Telephones used to connect to wires
- Dumb devices / dumb end-stations
- Smart network

Internet
- Complexity is in devices
- Dawn of the stupid network = Internet


## End to end argument
If you're not able to completely implement a service correctly, then just leave it to the ends.
Smart end-stations

End to end encryption
- Can't trust devices, government, then implement encryption at the end-devices
- End-stations has all the layers in the protocol stack
- Switch only had 2 layers, routers only has 3 layers
    - They're not that smart
