## Nuts-and-bolts
**End systems** are connected by a network of **communication links** and **packet switches**

**Transmission rate**: rate at which links transmit data (bits/second)

A **packet switch** receives a packet from a communication link and forwards it on an outgoing communication link.
- Routers and link-layer switches are examples of packet switches

**Route/Path**: A sequence of communication links and packet switches traversed by a packet from the sending end system to the receiving end system

End systems access the Internet through **Internet Service Providers (ISP)**.
- **Residential ISPs**: local cable, telephone companies
- **Corporate ISPs**
- **University ISPs**
- Each ISP is itself a network of packet switches and communication links.
