## Problem

Let $H$ be a graph with $\Delta(H) = k$. Let $G$ be a graph on at least $|G|$ vertices
with the property that, for every collection $X$ of $k$ vertices in $V(G)$,
$$\left|\bigcap_{x\in{X}} N(x)\right| \geq |H| - 1.$$
Prove, or provide a counterexample: $G$ has a subgraph isomorphic to $H$.

## Proof

Let $H$ be defined as above and $V(H) = \{v_1,\dots, v_n\}$.
Label a vertex in $G$ to be $v_1$.
Inductively, suppose we have a subgraph of $G$ isomorphic to $H[v_1,\dots, v_i]$, $i < n$.
Let $X = N_H(v_{i+1})\cap\{v_1,\dots, v_i\}$.
Since $|N_H(v_{i+1})| \leq k$, $|X| \leq k$, so $\left|\bigcap_{x\in{X}}N_G(x)\right| \geq |H| - 1$.
$i$ vertices have been chosen by the current step, so
there are at most $i - 1$ vertices in $N_H(v_i)$ that have been chosen.
$$\left|\bigcap_{x\in{X}} N_G(x)\right| - (i - 1)\geq |H| - 1 - (i-1)\geq |H| - 1 - (|H| - 2) \geq 1.$$
This implise there is at least 1 unchosen vertex that has all the right neighbours to be $v_{i+1}$.
Choose that as $v_{i+1}$ in the subgraph.
