## Problem
Let $G$ be a graph with $\delta(G) + \Delta(G) \geq |G| - 1$. Show that $G$ is connected with $diam(G) \leq 4$.

## Proof
Let $u$, $v$ be vertices of $G$.
Let $w$ be a vertex, such that $d(w) = \Delta(G)$.
Then, $d(u) + d(w) \geq \delta(G) + \Delta(G) \geq |G| - 1$.
If $u = w$, then $d(u, w) = 0$.
If $uw\in{E(G)}$, $d(u, w) = 1$.
Now suppose neither of the cases above holds.
Then, $d(u) + d(w) \geq |G| - 1$ implies $u$ and $w$ must share at least 1 common neighbour $x$.
We can similarly show $w$ and $v$ has a common neighbour $y$.
Then, $uxwyv$ is a $u-v$ path in $G$, so $d(x, y) \leq 4$.
In all cases $d(x, y) \leq 4$, so $diam(G) \leq 4$.
