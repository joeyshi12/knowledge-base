## Theorem 6.11 (Posa)
Let $G$ be a graph of order $n\geq 3$.
If: for every integer $j$ with $1\leq j < n/2$,
the number of vertices of $G$ with degree at most $j$ is less than $j$, then $G$ is Hamiltonian.

## Example

![[Thm 6.11 2023-03-06 15.46.06.excalidraw]]

Degree sequence: 3, 3, 3, 3, 4
$n = 6$, $1 \leq j < 3$

| j   | \# vertices of degree less than j |
| --- | --------------------------------- |
| 1   | > 0                               |
| 2   | > 1                               |
| 3   | 5 (NO)                            |
| 4   | 6 (NO)                            |

Posa's theorem says $G$ is Hamiltonian.
