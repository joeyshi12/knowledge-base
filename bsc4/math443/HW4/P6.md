## Problem
Let $G$ be a $k$-connected graph.
Form $G'$ by adding 1 vertex to $G$ and making it
adjacent to at least $k$ vertices. Then, $G'$ is also $k$-connected.

## Solution
Consider the separating set $S$ of $G'$ above and
let $v$ be the new vertex that was added to $G'$.

**Case 1**: $v\in{S}$
Then, $G' - S = G - (S - v)$ implies $S - v$ is a separating set of $G
