# Problem
For all positive integers $k$, describe a graph $G_k$, such that
$\lambda(G_k) = k$ and $\kappa(G_k) = 1$.

## Solution
$G_k = A_k + B_k$, where $A_k, B_k$ are complete graphs of order $k+1$
that share 1 common vertex $v$ and no edges.
$v$ is a cut vertex, so $\kappa(G_k) = 1$.
To separate 2 vertices from the same clique, we need to remove at least $k$ edges.
To separate 2 vertices from different cliques, we need to remove all paths
from a vertex in 1 clique to $v$, which will take $k$ edges.
So, $\lambda(G_k) = k$.
