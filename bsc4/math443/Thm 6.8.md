## Theorem 6.8 (Bondy, Chvatal)
Let $u$, $v$ be distinct nonadjacent vertices in a graph of order $n$,
such that $d(u) + d(v)\geq n$.
Then, $G$ is Hamiltonian iff $G + uv$ is Hamiltonian.

## Proof
If $G$ is Hamiltonian, then $G + uv$ is Hamiltonian.
Suppose $G + uv$ is Hamiltonian. Then, $G$ has a Hamiltonian path with endpoints $u, v$.
(Now repeat the Ore proof in [[Thm 6.6]]).
