# Observation

Suppose $G$ is 3-regular and Hamiltonian $|G|$ is even.
$2\|G\| = \sum d(v) = 3|G|$.

So let $C$ be a Hamiltonian cycle of $G$ $\chi'(C) = 2$.
$G - C$ is 1-regular make that its colour class => $\chi'(G) = 3$.

# Tait's 4 colour theorem proof (which is wrong)

Every cubic map is Hamiltonian (False, this is where the proof breaks).
Therefore, every cubic map is 3-edge colourable by above observation.
Therefore, the regions of every cubic map can be properly coloured with $\leq 4$ colours [[Thm 10.18 Tait]].
Therefore, the regions of every planar map can be coloured using $\leq 4$ colours (last time).
4 colour thm true.
