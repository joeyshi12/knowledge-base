# Theorem (Vizing)
For every nontrivial graph $G$,
$\Delta(G)\leq \chi'(G)\leq \Delta(G) + 1$.

Note: any 2 edges assigned the same colour in a proper edge colouring are non-adjacent,
meaning they share no endpoint.
So, in an $n$-vertex graph, each colour is assigned to at most $\lfloor n/2\rfloor$ edges (all edges have unique endpoints).
