## Problem
$g(G)$ is the length of the smallest cycle in $G$.
Prove or disprove: $g(G) \leq 2diam(G) + 1$ for all $G$ containing a cycle.

## Solution
Let $C$ be the smallest cycle in $G$.
Then, for any pair of vertices in $C$, the shortest path between them is contained in $C$.
So, if $g(C) \geq 2diam(G) + 2$, then there is an antipodal
pair of vertices $x, y$ in $C$ for which $d(x, y) \geq diam(G) + 1$, which is a contradiction.
Hence, $g(C) \leq 2diam(G) + 1$.
