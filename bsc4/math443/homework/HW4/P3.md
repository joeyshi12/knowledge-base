BWOC, let $P$ be the longest path in $G$ and suppose an endpoint of $P$ is a cut vertex $v$.
Since $v$ is an endpoint, $P - v$ is connected.
Also, $G - v$ is disconnected, so let $v_1, v_2$ be neighbours of $v$ in components $G_1, G_2$.
Since $P$ is the longest path, $N(v) \subseteq V(P)$, so $v_1, v_2\in{V(P)}$.
$P - v$ is connected, so $P - v$ contains a $v_1-v_2$ path which does not contain $v$.
This is a contradiction.
Hence, the endpoint of $P$ cannot be a cut vertex.
