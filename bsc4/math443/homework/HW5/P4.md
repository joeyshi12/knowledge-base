## Problem
Let $G$ be a nontrivial connected graph and
let $R$ be the equivalence class be the equivalence relation:
- For all $e,f\in{E(G)}$, $eRf$ iff $e = f$ or $e$ and $f$ lie on a common cycle of $G$.

1. Prove or disprove: given an equivalence class $\mathcal{E}$ of $R$, $G[\mathcal{E}]$ is nonseparable.
2. Prove or disprove: given an equivalence class $\mathcal{E}$ of $R$, $G[\mathcal{E}] \leq G$.
3. Prove or disprove: given an equivalence class $\mathcal{E}$ of $R$, $G[\mathcal{E}]$ is a block of $G$.
4. Prove or disprove: for every block $B$ of $G$, $E(B)$ is an equivalence class of $R$.

## Solution (1)
BWOC, suppose $G[\mathcal{E}]$ is separable and let $v$ be a cut vertex of $G[\mathcal{E}]$.
Then, $G[\mathcal{E}] - v$ has at least 2 components $G_1$ and $G_2$.
Let $v_1$ and $v_2$ be neighbours of $v$ in $G_1$ and $G_2$ respectively.
Since $vv_1\in\mathcal{E}$ and $vv_2\in\mathcal{E}$ and $vv_1 \neq vv_2$, $vv_1$ and $vv_2$ lie on a common cycle $C$.
Then, $C - v$ is a $v_1-v_2$ path in $G$ that does not contain the cut vertex $v$.
This is a contradiction.
Hence, $G[\mathcal{E}]$ is nonseparable.

## Solution (2)
Since $\mathcal{E} \subseteq E$, we have $G[\mathcal{E}] \subseteq G$.
Suppose $uv\in{E(G)}$ for some $u, v\in{G[\mathcal{E}]}$.
Since $u, v\in{G[\mathcal{E}]}$,
