## Problem
Prove or disprove:
Let $G$ be a regular graph with $|G| > 2$. Then, $G$ is reconstructible.

## Proof
The degree sequence of $G$ is recognizable from the deck,
so we know it is $r$-regular.
Now for any card in the deck, identify the $r$ vertices of degree $r-1$
and add a new vertex adjacent to all of them.
This is $G$.
