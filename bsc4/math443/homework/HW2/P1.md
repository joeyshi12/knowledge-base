## Problem
Prove that a nonnegative list of integers $d_1,\dots, d_n$
is the degree sequence of a multigraph iff the sum is even.

## Proof
Suppose $d_1,\dots, d_n$ is graphical.
Then, the sum of degrees is $2\|G\|$, which is even.

Now suppose the sum of entries is even.
Let $V = \{v_1,\dots, v_n\}$ and let $E$ be defined as follows:
- If $d_i$ is even, then add an edge from $v_i$ to $v_i$ $d_i/2$ times
- If $d_i$ is odd,
    - add an edge from $v_i$ to $v_i$ $(d_i - 1)/2$ times
    - since the sum of entries is even, the number of odd entries must be even,
    - so add an edge from $v_i$ to the next odd vertex in $V$
The result is a multigraph $G = (V, E)$, where $d(v_i) = d_i$.
