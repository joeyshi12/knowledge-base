## Learning Goals
- Compare and contrast [[OLAP]] and [[OLTP]] processing (e.g., focus, clients, amount of data, abstraction levels, concurrency, and accuracy).
- Explain the ETL tasks (i.e., extract, transform, load) for data warehouses.
- Explain the differences between a star schema design and a snowflake design for a data warehouse, including potential tradeoffs in performance.
- Argue for the value of a data cube in terms of:
- The type of data in the cube (numeric, categorical, temporal, counts, sums)
- The goals of OLAP (e.g., summarization, abstractions), and
- The operations that can be performed (drill-down, roll-up, slicing/dicing).
- Estimate the complexity of a data cube, in terms of the number of equivalent aggregation queries.
