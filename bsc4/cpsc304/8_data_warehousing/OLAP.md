## OLAP Queries
- For admin users
- Are full of groupings and aggregations.
- The natural way to think about such queries is in terms of a multidimensional model, which is an extension of the table model in regular relational databases.
- This model focuses on:
    - a set of numerical measures: quantities that are important for business analysis, like sales, etc.
    - a set of dimensions: entities on which the measures depend on, like location, date, etc.
