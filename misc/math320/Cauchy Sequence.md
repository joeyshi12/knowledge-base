# Cauchy Sequence
A Cauchy sequence $\{x_n\}$ in a [[Metric Space]] $X$ is a sequence, such that $\forall \epsilon > 0, \exists N\in\mathbb{N}, \forall n,m\geq N,\, d(x_n, d_m) < \epsilon$.

## Lemma 3.11
Cauchy sequences are bounded

## Theorem 3.11
- Convergent sequences are Cauchy
- If $\{x_n\}\subset X$ is Cauchy and $X$ is compact, then $\{x_n\}$ converges
- Every Cauchy sequence in $\mathbb{R}^k$ converges.
