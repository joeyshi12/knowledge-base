## Choosing the graph
- Bar graph: show variables are independent of each other
- Pie charts: show how whole is divided into parts
- Line graphs: show change over time

## Design charts and graphs
- What do you need for each axis?
- What does the bar/line stand for?
- What's the scale?
- Example title: Figure 1. Scatter plot - Education XX and GDP

## Writing the methodology - Visualization
- Report data processing / screening / cleansing
    - Grouping? Average?
- Write purpose of choosing visualization / specific graph

## Writing up the results (Steps)
Purpose: describe what has been found to answer RQ
- Remind readers of RQ + what graphs has been done (remind readers of pro)

**Reminders**
- Limit number of graphs (1-2)
- Rating Scale = Continuous (Highly recommended - no pie chart)
- Ensure 'self-sufficiency'
