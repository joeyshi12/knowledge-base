## Notes
Ask audience response, engage audience in intro
- e.g., have you ever thought of this?

Make sense - Background / RQ / Methodology

Results - give an idea on the trend WITH support, NOT EVERYTHING

Discussion (2 themes)
- Satisfactory + citations + make sense
- Satisfactory + interesting

Research question (BIG WORDS IN A SINGLE SLIDE)

Don't copy too many sentences from critical summary
