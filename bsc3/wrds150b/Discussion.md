> To produce knowledge, you must relate to other studies

## Discussion Themes
- Explanations of interesting patterns
- Explanation of unexpected results
- **Comparison of previous studies and explain the differences / similarities (those in state of knowledge)**
- Implications (research / practice)

## Interesting pattern
(Topic sentence). This study found that XXXX. One **possible** reason may be XXXXX (Explanation). This is similar to what XXX has suggested in his / study (Citation). For example, .....(ELB from citation). This shows that XXX can be the main reason for XXXX (Concluding sentence)

## Unexpected result
(Topic sentence). This study found that XXXX. This seems to be **unexpected** because XXXXX (what was expected). Such surprising results may be explained by XXXX (reason). For example, ....(ELB from citation). XXX has made a similar comment in his/her study (Citation as support). This may explain why this is CCCC (Concluding sentence)

## Comparison to previous studies (REQUIRED)
(Topic sentence). This study found that XXXX. **This echoes past studies** on XXX. However, the key difference (or this is similar to what has been found from the past study) (citation as comparison). XXXXX (Elaboration from citation / Your results). Such difference can be explained by XXX. For example, the sample in this study was YYYY but the sample in XXX was GGGG. The differences in UUUU (sample) would affect XXX. Therefore, XXXXX (concluding sentence).

## Implications
(Topic sentence). This study found that XXXX. This may have a **significant impact to** RESEARCHERS / PRACTITIONERS (ideally, be more specific). With such results, they need to (elaboration). XXX has made a similar comment in his/her study (citation for support). These measures strategies could hopefully reduce / enhance impact brought by XXX (concluding sentence).
