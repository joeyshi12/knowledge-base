## State of knowledge + Summary of Sources (Writing about Research WS)
[[Sources]]


## Research Gap (WS From SK -> RG -> RQ)


## Datasets + Analysis
[[Datasets]]
- Dataset descriptions (Methodology WS - Media Gallery)
- Nature of sample (e.g. participants) (Methodology WS - Media Gallery)
- Variables (Methodology WS - Media Gallery)
- Describe processing, screening, cleansing procedures (Methodology WS - Media Gallery)
- Data analysis (Methodology WS - Media Gallery)
- Innovative research methodology with big data (Open Data WS)
    - Create data set and innovative data analysis strategies
