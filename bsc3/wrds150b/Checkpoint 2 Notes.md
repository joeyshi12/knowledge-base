## Methods
The scatter plot of the infection rate and unemployment rate does not appear to follow a normal distribution. Hence, the normality assumption failed.

Thus, this study will measure this associations with the Spearman correlation coefficient.

## Results
The Spearman correlation coefficient between infection rate and unemployment rate across multiple countries is low & negative. The P-value attained is 0.7904, so it is unlikely that there is a relationship between our 2 variables.


Both studies used Pearson correlation coefficient
