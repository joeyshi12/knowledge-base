## Binary search tree

A binary search tree is a binary tree in which every node fits a specific ordering property: `all left descendents <= n < all right descendents` for each node `n`.
> This definition may vary: some may say a tree cannot have duplicate values and others may say the duplicate values must be on the right side

## Complete Binary Tree
Every level in the tree is fully filled, except for perhaps the last level.
The last level must be filled left to right.

## Full Binary Tree

Every node in a full binary tree has either 0 or 2 children. i.e., no nodes have only one child.

## Perfect Binary Tree

A perfect binary tree is full and complete.
